# Recursion

Constains series of experiements to better under recursion.

##### Types of Recursions

- Tree recursion

- Iterative recursion

![graph2](./exp-order-of-growth/func-graph/test-output/factorial_5.png? "Example of factorial recursion which grows into iterative (linear) like shape ")

- Mutual recursion

##### Order of Growth

- This experiment helps to visualize order of growth for recursive functions

![graph1](./exp-order-of-growth/func-graph/test-output/fib_5_order_of_growth.png? "Graph showing order of growth for fib(5)")

use the decorator drawtreee to be able to output dot graph as shown above
